# Validatation-of-SQL-queriess

Creating a SQL query validation script entails building a computer programme that verifies the syntax and semantics of SQL statements to verify they are legitimate and can be performed without problems. The script may be written to execute in a variety of settings, including command-line tools, web applications, and integrated development environments (IDEs).

The script can validate SQL queries by checking the SQL syntax, verifying the validity of column and table names, ensuring that the data types of operands match the expected types, checking for the presence of required clauses (e.g., WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY), and validating the join conditions.

The advantages of writing a script to validate SQL queries include better code quality and a lower chance of mistakes and security issues. The script can save time and effort by discovering faults early in the development process, eliminating costly mistakes and allowing developers to focus on developing efficient and effective queries.
